##Article 1: “Failure of a chemical spray to significantly reduce stereotypic licking in a captive giraffe” 
	
In the article “Failure of a chemical spray to significantly reduce stereotypic licking in a captive giraffe”, researchers hypothesized that applying a bitter chemical to the areas of the fence most licked by the giraffe would reduce stereotypic licking behaviors. There was no specific control group mentioned in the study, however the giraffe’s baseline data was utilized to compare the frequency of licking before and after application of the bitter chemical. Potential critiques of the study include the small sample size of one giraffe and the use of only one aversive stimulus for deterrence. The results of the study showed that the underlying motivation driving the behavior was unaffected by the aversive stimulus, therefore the hypothesis was not supported. A hypothesis that could build on top of the research presented in this study is to investigate the effectiveness of other types of taste deterrents or other methods of reducing stereotypic licking in giraffes.
