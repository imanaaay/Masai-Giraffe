### Introduction:
 Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi, commonly known as the Masai Giraffe, is the largest subspecies of giraffes, and among the tallest quadruped animals in the world. These endangered herbivores have been in captivity for many years, as we readily see them in our sanctuaries and zoos. They exhibit unnatural and non-beneficial physical behaviors across these differing captive environments. One major observed action in these captured animals is associated with oral activities, such as stereotypic licking, which is not seen in their respective wild counterparts. Stereotypic licking can be defined as a recurring motion focused on non-food related objects. The manifestation of these repetitive and addictive behaviors remains inconclusive. Research studies have begun to explore what allures the captive Masai Giraffe to adopt these actions. Previous studies have indicated that certain aversive stimuli fail to alter this conduct. Other studies have explored how controlling, introducing, or reducing foraging encouragements, nutritional modifications, and human interaction impact a captive Masai Giraffe’s physical performances. However, the scope of these studies is limited. Typically, the studies are focused on Masai Giraffes in only a few enclosures; they are too narrow to draw any definitive conclusions.  There is still much to consider regarding this observed behavior in captive Masai Giraffes. While what universally creates these behaviors remains unresolved, the purpose of this study is to try and gain insight into how captivity can greatly impact this animal’s natural instincts and cause them to lose their instinctual disposition, leading them to adopt odd behaviors as a result.


#### Article 1: “Failure of a chemical spray to significantly reduce stereotypic licking in a captive giraffe” 
	
In the article “Failure of a chemical spray to significantly reduce stereotypic licking in a captive giraffe”, researchers hypothesized that applying a bitter chemical to the areas of the fence most licked by the giraffe would reduce stereotypic licking behaviors. There was no specific control group mentioned in the study, however the giraffe’s baseline data was utilized to compare the frequency of licking before and after application of the bitter chemical. Potential critiques of the study include the small sample size of one giraffe and the use of only one aversive stimulus for deterrence. The results of the study showed that the underlying motivation driving the behavior was unaffected by the aversive stimulus, therefore the hypothesis was not supported. A hypothesis that could build on top of the research presented in this study is to investigate the effectiveness of other types of taste deterrents or other methods of reducing stereotypic licking in giraffes.

#### Article 2: “The effects of increased hay-to-grain ratio on behavior, metabolic health measures, and fecal bacterial communities in four Masai giraffe at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo”

In the article “The effects of increased hay-to-grain ratio on behavior, metabolic health measures, and fecal bacterial communities in four Masai giraffe at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo”, researchers hypothesized that a higher hay-to-grain ratio and increased time spent feeding would maintain or increase the serum Ca2+:P-, decrease serum insulin-to-glucose ratios, maintain leptin levels (as a measure of body condition), and significantly alter fecal bacterial communities. The giraffes’ condition at baseline served as the control for the purposes of this study. Potential critiques of this study include the small sample size of four giraffes and limited evaluation of nutrient analysis, due to its production by a manufacturer rather than analysis of what was fed. A hypothesis that could build on top of the research presented in this study is examining the long-term health and welfare benefits of forage-based diets in Masai giraffes housed in captivity.

#### Article 3: “Effects of Guest Feeding Programs on Captive Giraffe Behavior” 
	
In the article “Effects of guest feeding programs on captive giraffe behavior”, researchers aimed to assess the impacts of guest feeding programs on captive giraffe behavior and welfare, as well as identify any potential management strategies that may mitigate any negative consequences. They did this by comparing the time budgets of giraffes in zoos with and without guest feeding programs, the zoos without guest feeding programs can be considered as the control group in this study. The dependent variables of the study are the time budgets of giraffes, including both normal and stereotypic behaviors, in relation to the independent variable of participation in guest feeding programs. Some critiques of this study include its limited duration of only one summer, and its limit of nine zoo locations, since results may not be a true representation of giraffe behavior throughout the year or in different environmental conditions and locations. A hypothesis that could build on top of the research presented in this study is that modifying the timing or frequency of guest feeding programs, to smaller and more frequent feedings, will reduce idleness and other associated negative outcomes associated with these programs in Masai giraffes.

#### Article 4: A survey assessment of variables related to stereotypy in captive giraffe and okapi

In the article “A survey assessment of variables related to stereotypy in captive giraffe and okapi”, researchers hypothesized that if giraffes and okapi are monitored in captivity, they will have stereotypical behaviors. As a control, researchers used other research on giraffes that displayed stereotypical behavior such as licking. This baseline data helped them compare the results that they found to prove the hypothesis true. The independent variables in this study were the number of hours the individuals spent indoors, access at night to conspecifics, feeding frequency, method of feeding, and type of food provided were predictors of stereotypic licking. Subspecies, birth history, size of the indoor enclosure, environmental change, and type of food provided were found to be significant predictors of stereotypic pacing. A potential critique that I have for this study is the observation of two different animals simultaneously. This study focused on giraffes and okapi and I think it would have been more effective if they chose one species to study. According to the results, many more giraffes were studied than okapi so I think they should have just focused on one. Due to references of gender differences amongst the giraffes, another potential hypothesis that we can make is that if female giraffes are put into stressful situations, they will perform stereotypical behaviors such as licking or pacing.

#### Article 5: Tongue twisters: feeding enrichment to reduce oral stereotypy in giraffe

In the article “Tongue twisters: feeding enrichment to reduce oral stereotypy in giraffe”, researchers hypothesized that if giraffes are encouraged to engage in more realistic foraging behavior, then oral stereotypy can be reduced in herbivores. This study was conducted and tested at a zoo in Atlanta, Georgia in both holding and exhibit areas. The data was collected using instantaneous scan sampling of the giraffes’ interactions with the complex feeder and its behavior after. In this study, it was found that the most prevalent stereotypical behavior in giraffes is licking of non food objects. The independent variable was the complex feeder, which allowed the giraffe to use more tongue movement to eat, rather than using licking as a sign of boredom or stereotype. A potential critique that I have for this study is to have and observe a control group in the same situations so that it is easier and more effective to compare data. One hypothesis that could be used to continue research is that if giraffes are fed strictly outdoors, the stereotypical behaviors will decrease.
